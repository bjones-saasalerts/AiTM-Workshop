Pre-reqs and reference material for the server build portion of the workshop!

## ✅ Pre-requisite Requirements
Before proceeding with the workshop, ensure you have the following:

1. **A Domain Name**  
   - Any domain will work. You can purchase an affordable one from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) or any other domain registrar.

2. **A VPS (Virtual Private Server)**  
   - You will have **one year of access** to the VPS, but you can cancel at any time.  
   - Your VPS must have at least **1 GB of memory**.  
   - You can pick from the options below in the hosting plans section OR provide your own.
   - Ports that should be accessible - **53, 80, 443, 22**

3. **Operating System**  
   - Your VPS should be running **Ubuntu 22.04 64 Bit** as the operating system.
   - If you decide to run a different OS, please make sure it's Debian based.

4. **A Computer with SSH Access**  
   - If you’re on **Windows**, you can use **Windows Terminal** or **PuTTY**.  
   - If you’re on **Linux** or **macOS**, SSH is built in and ready to use.

5. **Basic Linux Knowledge (Optional, but Helpful)**  
   - Understanding basic commands like `cd`, `ls`, `nano`, `sudo`, and `apt` will be beneficial.  
   - No worries if you're new to Linux – we’ll guide you through the essentials.
